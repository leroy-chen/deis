Planning Process
================
Deis features a lightweight process that emphasizes openness and ensures every community member can be an integral part of planning for the future.

The Role of Maintainers
-----------------------
`Maintainers`_ lead the project. Their duties include proposing the Roadmap, reviewing and integrating contributions and maintaining the vision of the project.

Open Roadmap
------------
The :ref:`roadmap` is a community document. While Maintainers propose the Roadmap, it gets discussed and refined in Release Planning Meetings.

Contributing to the Roadmap
---------------------------
Proposals and issues can be opened by anyone. Every member of the :ref:`community` is welcome to participate in the discussion by providing feedback and/or offering counter-proposals.

Release Milestones
------------------
The Roadmap gets delivered progressively via the :ref:`release_schedule`.  Releases are defined during Release Planning Meetings and managed using GitHub Milestones which track specific deliverables and work-in-progress.

Release Planning Meetings
-------------------------
Major decisions affecting the Roadmap are discussed during Release Planning Meetings on the first Thursday of each month, aligned with the :ref:`release_schedule`.

Release Planning Meetings are open to the public with access coordinated via the #deis IRC channel on Freenode.
Notes from past meetings are below, along with links to a recording of the entire meeting on YouTube.
